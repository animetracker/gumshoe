## Description
Search for any anime that you are interested in and add it to your list. Once in your list it will automatically remind you of new episode releases.

Are you in a different time zone? Do you use a streaming service that releases later or sooner than we expect? Change the air dates supplied by us to match your needs.

Want to be reminded some time before or after the new episode releases? You can do that in seconds by customising when you are notified of a new release.

Gumshoe is simple and minimalistic. This app is designed as the best tool for anyone ranging from an anime newbie to an enthusiast that watches any and all anime.

"Never miss an episode with Gumshoe".

*Please keep in mind this app is currently in its beta phase, we are open to all feedback on how we can enhance your experience. Let us know using our discord ([https://discord.gg/s2C8eJ2](https://discord.gg/s2C8eJ2)) or by emailing us at gumshoeteam@gmail.com.
